# WWE Final Reflections

<!-- TODO: Go through the code and heavily comment it to show your understanding. -->
<!-- TODO: Reflect on your experience parsing this code. Give your unique perspective on this code. What makes sense? What doesn't? Overall, how did this code connect back to JS concepts that you have learned throughout the course? Add anything interesting or relevant that you would like including any other analogies, connections, thoughts or reflections. Be unique/creative! 🧚🏾‍♂️ :)-->

# HTML Structure

The HTML structure follows the standard format, with the `<head>` section containing metadata and links to external resources, and the `<body>` section containing the main content of the page. The use of semantic HTML elements like `<div>` with appropriate class names enhances readability and maintainability.

# JavaScript Integration

The JavaScript code interacts with the HTML DOM to dynamically render content based on the application state. This exemplifies the power of JavaScript in creating interactive and dynamic web experiences. The use of `getElementById` and event listeners demonstrates fundamental DOM manipulation techniques.

# Modularization

The use of `import` and `export` statements in JavaScript indicates modularization of code, promoting better code organization and reusability. This aligns with the concept of modularity in software development, allowing developers to break down complex systems into smaller, manageable components.

# Styling

The inclusion of a separate CSS file (`style.css`) for styling ensures separation of concerns, where HTML is responsible for structure, JavaScript for functionality, and CSS for presentation. This adheres to the principle of separation of concerns, making the codebase more maintainable and easier to collaborate on.

# Responsive Design

The use of viewport meta tag (`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />`) in the HTML `<head>` ensures that the web application is responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes and devices. This emphasizes the importance of responsive design for providing a consistent user experience across various platforms.

# Overall Connection to JS Concepts

This code illustrates key JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, modularization, and integration with HTML and CSS. It showcases the practical application of these concepts in building modern web applications. Understanding these fundamental concepts is crucial for any JavaScript developer, as they form the foundation for creating dynamic and interactive web experiences.
